            <h2>Usability Test Findings</h2>
            <p>After conducting usability tests with three participants on Craigslist.org, several important patterns and challenges were observed. These are analyzed below following the structure in Chapter 8: Top Findings, Severity Codes, and Recommendations.</p>
          
            <section>
              <h3>1. Top Findings</h3>
                <section>
                    <h4>Initial Overwhelm from Layout</h4>
                    <p>Users were momentarily disoriented due to the dense, text-heavy homepage and lack of visual structure.</p>
                    
                    <h5>what was observe?</h5>
                    <p>When users first landed on the Craigslist homepage, they expressed confusion and hesitation. The layout offers very little visual hierarchy—categories, links, and geographic areas are tightly packed into a text-heavy interface. This caused a few seconds of pause as users oriented themselves, unsure where to start. However, this confusion faded once they began interacting with the site.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Fast Learning Curve</h4>
                    <p>Despite the layout, users adapted quickly due to the site’s simple structure and limited navigation paths.</p>
                    <h5>what was observe?</h5>
                    <p>Despite the initial overwhelm, users were able to learn how to navigate Craigslist very quickly. Its minimal design means fewer distractions and limited pathways. For example, users posting listings followed a simple step-by-step structure, and those searching for jobs or items quickly understood how the filtering and categories worked. The simplicity actually helped reduce long-term confusion.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Confusing Wording During Posting</h4>
                    <p>Labels like “Posting Title” or “Area” led to hesitation and minor mistakes during post creation.</p>
                    <h5>what was observe?</h5>
                    <p>During the post creation process, participants encountered vague or overly broad labels. One user wasn’t sure what “CL mail relay” asking what it mean? Another hesitated when asked for their “Area,” unsure how specific it needed to be. These small wording issues created small delays and could lead to posting errors, especially for first-time users.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Easy Recovery from Errors</h4>
                    <p>Users could backtrack and correct mistakes easily thanks to Craigslist’s linear and preview-based flow.</p>
                    <h5>what was observe?</h5>
                    <p>When users made mistakes, Craigslist made it easy for them to go back and correct them. The platform allows previews and editing before finalizing posts, which gave users the confidence to proceed even when unsure. This level of error recovery added to users’ sense of control and reduced anxiety about making irreversible mistakes.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Functional but Outdated</h4>
                    <p>All users acknowledged the outdated visual design, but also praised its speed and clarity once understood.</p>
                    <h5>what was observe?</h5>
                    <p>All users noted that Craigslist feels outdated in terms of design. It lacks modern UI elements like icons, color cues, or dynamic feedback. But despite this, users said they preferred how “to-the-point” the site was. It loads fast, isn’t visually cluttered with ads or animations, and allows them to accomplish their goals quickly. Its core UX works well, even if it looks like a website from the early 2000s.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Confusion When No Local Results Are Found</h4>
                    <p>When searches returned no matches near a user's area, the interface failed to clearly signal this, leading to misdirected interactions.</p>
                    <h5>what was observe?</h5>
                    <p>One common issue occurred when users searched for listings in their area and Craigslist showed "no results" but didn’t visually emphasize it. Users often overlooked this message and scrolled straight to the "recommended" listings, which were outside their location. This led to confusion and unintentional interest in irrelevant results.</p>

              <h3>2. Severity Codes</h3>
              <p>Each issue is rated using a 0–4 severity scale, based on impact, frequency, and persistence:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>0 =</strong> Not a usability problem</li>
                <li><strong>1 =</strong> Cosmetic problem only</li>
                <li><strong>2 =</strong> Minor usability problem</li>
                <li><strong>3 =</strong> Major usability problem</li>
                <li><strong>4 =</strong> Usability catastrophe</li>
              </ul>
          
              <table>
                <thead>

                    <td>Search results with no local matches are unclear, leading users to skip results they intended to see</td>

                  </tr>

              </table>
            </section>
          
            <section>
              <h3>3. Recommendations for Improvement</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Add section headings or separators</strong> on the homepage to visually group links (e.g., For Sale, Jobs, Services) to improve scannability.</li>
                <li><strong>Update the “Posting Title” field label</strong> to read “Title of Your Listing (what people will see)” for clarity during post creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Include tooltips or hover text</strong> for ambiguous terms like “Area” and “Posting Body” to reduce user hesitation and errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve preview post formatting</strong> to more closely match the final live post so users better understand what they’re submitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a brief “New Here?” guide or link</strong> for first-time users explaining how to post, browse, and respond to listings.</li>
                <li><strong>Modernize basic layout spacing</strong> with subtle use of padding, font size variation, and whitespace to reduce initial cognitive load without affecting speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Make “No Results Found” messages more visually prominent</strong>, and add a clear separator between local results and “recommended nearby” results so users don’t confuse them.</li>
              </ol>
            </section>
          
            <section>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>Craigslist.org proves that a simple, utilitarian interface can still succeed in providing a highly usable experience. Although it lacks the aesthetic and clarity of more modern platforms, its straightforward task flow, error tolerance, and fast performance give it enduring strength. With just a few improvements in labeling, layout, and first-time guidance, it could better support new users without losing its core efficiency.</p>
