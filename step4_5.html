                        <h3>Scenario: The Last-Minute Sublet</h3>
                        <p>
                            With finals coming up, Olivia also needs to sublet her apartment for summer break. She logs into Craigslist and starts crafting a listing for her studio near campus. She struggles with the plain-text formatting, unsure if line breaks or links will render properly.
                            She previews the post and realizes it’s missing images—she didn’t know uploading them wasn’t automatic. Then, while browsing other listings to compare, she notices hers is already buried under newer posts. She’s frustrated by the lack of visibility and limited filtering tools.
                            Olivia decides to manually repost every few days and include her email instead of using Craigslist’s reply system, which she finds unreliable.

                        <h3>Scenario: Need Help, Yesterday</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s Monday morning, and David urgently needs to hire a temporary worker after one of his employees called in sick for the week. He logs onto Craigslist to post a job ad. The form asks for more details than he expected—location, compensation type, and email verification.
                            He quickly fills it out, but accidentally selects the wrong category. His post doesn’t show up where he expected. David has to go back and edit, but finds the interface clunky and slow.
                            When responses come in, half are spam. He’s frustrated, thinking, “Why isn’t there a filter for serious applicants?”
