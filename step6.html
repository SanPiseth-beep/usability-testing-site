    <h3>Before the Session Starts</h3>
    <p><strong>Greeting:</strong><br>
    Hi! Thanks so much for agreeing to participate in this usability session. My name is [Your Name], and I’ll be moderating our session today.</p>

    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
    The purpose of this session is to evaluate how easy and intuitive Craigslist.org is to use. We're not testing you—just the website. If anything doesn't make sense or work smoothly, that's exactly what we're trying to find out.</p>

    <p><strong>Consent:</strong><br>
    Before we begin, do you have any questions about the consent form? [Pause]<br>
    Just a reminder that this session may be recorded for research purposes, but your identity will remain anonymous.</p>

    <h3>Session Overview</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>Then, you’ll complete a few tasks on Craigslist.org.</li>
      <li>Please think out loud as you go. Tell me what you’re doing, expecting, or confused by.</li>
      <li>If you get stuck, that’s okay—just tell me what you’re thinking.</li>
      <li>Afterward, I’ll ask for your feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>What’s your age and occupation?</li>
      <li>Have you used Craigslist before? What for?</li>
      <li>How comfortable are you with websites like Craigslist? (1–5 scale)</li>
      <li>What device do you normally use to browse the web?</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

    <h3>Task Instructions</h3>
    <p>I’ll read each task aloud and give you a moment to read it too. Please think out loud while completing the task.</p>
    <p><strong>Task Example:</strong><br>
    You’re a student who needs to sublet your apartment for the summer. Go ahead and create a post for your apartment, including a short description and any photos.</p>
