        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>Going through the entire usability testing process—from planning to conducting tests and analyzing the results—was a meaningful learning experience. It helped me better understand the user-centered design process in a hands-on way, and gave me new appreciation for how real users interact with websites.</p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts on Usability Testing</h3>
    
        <h4>1. I found the whole process really interesting and fun.</h4>
        <p>Before starting this project, I expected usability testing to be very technical and rigid. But what I discovered was that it's actually a creative and dynamic process. Building personas, crafting scenarios, and especially watching users interact with Craigslist in real-time was incredibly eye-opening. It was fun to predict what users might do—and then be surprised by what they actually did. It made me more curious about human behavior and how small design choices impact real experiences.</p>
    
        <h4>2. It was hard to get people to do a 30–60 minute recording, especially with time zones.</h4>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was scheduling user sessions. It’s not easy to coordinate when everyone has different availability, especially across multiple time zones. A 45-minute test might not sound long, but for many people, it was hard to commit to. I had to do a lot of follow-ups and be flexible with my own schedule. This taught me how important it is to plan ahead and be patient when working with real participants.</p>
    
        <h4>3. I learned that sometimes UX matters more than UI—in the case of Craigslist.</h4>
        <p>Craigslist is definitely not a “pretty” website, but surprisingly, most users had no trouble completing their tasks. This taught me that while visual design is important, usability and function are often more critical especially for task-focused users. A clean, flashy interface doesn’t matter much if people can't figure out how to do what they need. Craigslist proves that good UX can survive outdated aesthetics, as long as the structure is simple, fast, and predictable.</p>

        <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
        <p>This project made me realize that usability testing is not just for UX designers—anyone involved in creating digital products can benefit from it. It helps shift the focus away from assumptions and puts real users at the center of decision-making. I now feel more confident in my ability to plan, moderate, and analyze a usability test, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.</p>
